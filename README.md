# Blue-Green Deployment Strategy

This repository provides automation tools and scripts for implementing Blue-Green deployment strategies. Blue-Green deployment ensures seamless application updates with zero downtime by managing traffic between two environments.

## Features

- **Zero Downtime**: Switch between two environments (Blue and Green) with minimal disruption.
- **Automated Deployments**: Automate the process of deploying and switching traffic between Blue and Green environments.
- **Rollback Support**: Easily revert to the previous environment in case of issues.
- **Smooth Release Management**: Reduce deployment risk by testing in the inactive environment before going live.
